A simple blog created with a NextJS. There's a homepage with links to each blog post. The pages are created with data from the "posts" folder and passed through as props into the DOM. 

Note: I've yet to style this application. 

Deployed with Vercel: https://nextjsblog-sigma.vercel.app/

This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).
