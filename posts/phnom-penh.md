It’s beginning to hit me how fast this whole year is going to fly by. Thailand came and went in the blink of an eye. Work has me in holiday-mode, but my environment is still giving me summer-vibes. I dig it. No Christmas burnout for me this year!

Thailand remained very sleepy throughout October; the country mourning the loss of their King. At the beginning of November, my group packed up and took the bus, ferry, bus, plane, and bus to our new home in Cambodia.

Upon landing in Phnom Penh I immediately felt reenergized.  The city is busy and raw.  Streets are hectic and dusty due to the 1.3 million scooters on the road.  I realize that, personally, I feed off the energy of the city for my productivity.  If this remote experiment has taught me anything so far, it’s that.  And that caffeine is king.

Election night came and went, leaving me disappointed in and troubled about the state of the country I call home.  I’m thousands of miles away and, from the looks of my Facebook feed, people are passionately divided.  No point in dwelling.  I sought out to learn more about Cambodian history.  I toured a Cambodian torture prison and killing fields from the genocide that took place here just over 30 years ago.  Between 1975 and 1979, 3 Million people were killed in the name of creating a utopia for the Khmer Rouge.  Those that were tortured and killed were intellectuals, artists, and city dwellers who were considered a threat to the Khmer Rouge.  It struck me how recently these atrocities occurred.  Survivors are still around to tell their stories to tourists at memorials and museums.  Bones continue to surface after heavy rains over the fields that became mass graves.  It really puts things into perspective.  I can’t change what happened, and I can’t change the outcome of my election at home; but I can learn from the past and return home with a more complete world-view.
