Who knew Kuala Lumpur and Koh Phangan would be so totally different? I suppose anyone who has been to both. I was not ready for such a dramatic change, but I think I’m getting the hang of things. It seems like the most important quality I’ll need to cultivate for this remote year is adaptability.

After the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur, I settled into my Southeast Thai resort. While ‘Island Life’ should technically be more relaxed and slow, I have found myself busier than in KL. With the constant sunshine, blue waters, and a hot-pink scooter at my disposal, I tend to be always on the hunt for my next island adventure. This makes for a very sun-drained start to my work-day. My most current and effective solution: hydration.

During the first part of my stay in Thailand, the nation lost its King. Everything immediately shut down. Restaurants closed, markets stopped buzzing, and street vendors stayed home. The people of Thailand were in mourning. This is the first time I’ve really experienced any sort of culture shock. Here we are, a group of Americans in Thailand, and we’ve been told to be extremely careful with our behavior, conversation, and even dress for the next several weeks. Any behavior that could be interpreted as disrespectful could land one of us in serious legal trouble, specifically negative talk of the King or speculation about his successor. As the nation grieves, I slowly begin to digest the fact that I was present for a huge moment in Thailand, and even global history. What is my life?

My priorities for the next few weeks will be to continue work on my current clients, upload another new client, and hopefully give back to the local community in some way. As a participant of Remote Year, I have an opportunity to do some good in every place I visit. More on that next time you hear from me.
