excerpt: 'Well Kuala Lumpur came and went in the blink of an eye. Who knew turning your world upside down would make time fly? What have I learned in the first month of my Remote Year? Tons. In terms of working remotely on the other side of the world, I think it’s all about sticking to a schedule. Just like at home, I need to work set hours and make sure to unplug when it’s time to sleep. As far as the world is concerned, I’m starting to think other cultures may be more welcoming of foreigners than we are in the US. Sure I’ve only been abroad for a month, but everyone in KL was so welcoming and eager to speak to me… In my own language. I feel so spoiled.'

Well Kuala Lumpur came and went in the blink of an eye. Who knew turning your world upside down would make time fly? What have I learned in the first month of my Remote Year? Tons. In terms of working remotely on the other side of the world, I think it’s all about sticking to a schedule. Just like at home, I need to work set hours and make sure to unplug when it’s time to sleep. As far as the world is concerned, I’m starting to think other cultures may be more welcoming of foreigners than we are in the US. Sure I’ve only been abroad for a month, but everyone in KL was so welcoming and eager to speak to me… In my own language. I feel so spoiled.

My last couple of weeks in KL were kind of hectic. I had to squeeze in all the tourist spots I had missed, while also onboarding a new client, and keeping up with my day-to-day work. It was an exercise in operating under minimal sleep and in communicating well with my team. My days were spent exploring the canopies in one of the oldest and smallest rainforests in the world, checking out the Batu Caves, and standing in a glass box atop the Menara KL Tower. Nights were spent in the office or in bed, on calls, waiting for creative feedback, or catching up on emails while my LA counterparts slept. Exhausting as it might have been, I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

I’m on my first full day in Thailand and I can already tell it’s going to be a huge change of pace. We’re “stationed” in Koh Phangan, a laid back island in Southeast Thailand. I rented a hot-pink scooter for transport between my living accommodations and our workspace, BeacHub. I’ll be working, eating, and living within steps of the ocean. It’s incredible! The distractions are abundant, but so is the inspiration. I’m looking forward to more long days, local community outreach opportunities, and late nights at the office… #creatingAwesome.
